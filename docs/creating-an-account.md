# Creating your Proton account

One of the major design changes of Proton compared to EOS is the way you create an account. With Proton there's no need to worry about staking SYS tokens for CPU or RAM. We always found this to be a cumbersome and overly complex mechanism in EOS.

However, this means account creation is delegated to authorized institutions. These institutions have the permission to spin up new accounts but they have to make sure the users they're signing up are genuine.

Currently, your options are:
- Use the [Lynx wallet](https://www.lynxwallet.io/) application to spin up your Proton account
- Contact us at hello@protonchain.com and we'll help you set up your account
